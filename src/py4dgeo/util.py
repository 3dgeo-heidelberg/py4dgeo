    This can be used to describe the memory usage policy that py4dgeo

    set policy whenever it would make a memory allocation of the same order
    of magnitude as the input pointcloud or the set of corepoints.
    To globally set the policy, use :func:`~py4dgeo.set_memory_policy`.

    Currently the following policies are available:

    * :code:`STRICT`: py4dgeo is not allowed to do additional memory allocations.
      If such an allocation would be required, an error is thrown.
    * :code:`MINIMAL`: py4dgeo is allowed to do additional memory allocations if
      and only if they are necessary for a seemless operation of the library.
    * :code:`COREPOINTS`: py4dgeo is allowed to do additional memory allocations
      as part of performance trade-off considerations (e.g. precompute vs. recompute),
      but only if the allocation is on the order of the number of corepoints.
      This is the default behaviour of py4dgeo.
    * :code:`RELAXED`: py4dgeo is allowed to do additional memory allocations as
      part of performance trade-off considerations (e.g. precompute vs. recompute).
