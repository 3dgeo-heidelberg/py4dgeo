    "The `neighborhood_radius` parameter for this algorithm is of paramount importance: At each core point, a radius search with this radius is performed to determine which other core points are considered to be direct neighbors. This allows us to perform a region growing algorithm on a fully unstructured set of core points. The `seed_subsampling` parameter is used to speed up the generation of seed candidates by only investigating every 30th core point for change points in that core point's timeseries. This is only done to improve the usability of this notebook - for production runs you should omit that parameter (using its default of `1`)."
