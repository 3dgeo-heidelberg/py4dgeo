    "The `neighborhood_radius` parameter for this algorithm is of paramount importance: At each core point, a radius search with this radius is performed to determine which other core points are considered to be local neighbors during region growing. This allows us to perform region growing on a fully unstructured set of core points. The `seed_subsampling` parameter is used to speed up the generation of seed candidates by only investigating every n-th core point (here n=30) for changes in its timeseries. This is only done to improve the usability of this notebook - for real, full analysis you should omit that parameter (using its default of `1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further parameters can be set for the change point detection in the time series (cf. [Anders et al., 2020](#references)). The `window_width` defines the width of the sliding temporal window that moves along the signal and determines the discrepancy between the first and the second half of the window (i.e. subsequent time series segments). Change point detection is performed using a C++ reimplementation of the Python library ruptures ([Truong et al., 2018](#references)). The parameter `minperiod` controls the minimum period of a detected change feature to be considered as seed candidate. The `height_threshold` (default: `0.0`) specifies the required magnitude of a dectected change (i.e. unsigned difference between magnitude at start epoch and peak magnitude)."
