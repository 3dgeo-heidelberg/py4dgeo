`py4dgeo` is a `C++` library with `Python` bindings for change analysis in multitemporal and 4D point clouds.

Topographic 3D/4D point clouds are omnipresent in geosciences, environmental, ecological and archaeological sciences, robotics, and many more fields and applications. Technology to capture such data using laser scanning and photogrammetric techniques have evolved into standard tools. Dense time series of topographic point clouds are becoming increasing available and require tools for automatic analysis. Moreover, methods considering the full 4D (3D space + time) data are being developed in research and need to be made available in an accessible way with flexible integration into existent workflows.

The **main objective** of `py4dgeo` is to bundle and provide different methods of 3D/4D change analysis in a dedicated, comprehensive Python library.
`py4dgeo` is designed as an international open source project that can be integrated into almost any 3D and GIS software in the geodata domain supporting Python, e.g. as plugins.

`py4dgeo` is under *ongoing active development*.
Below, you find a list of [provided methods](#methods-provided-by-py4dgeo).


## üî® Methods provided by py4dgeo

* **M3C2 algorithm** ([Lague et al., 2013](#literature)) for bitemporal point cloud distance computation. The concept and algorithm is explained [in this tutorial by James Dietrich](https://youtu.be/xJql7h8M2_o), including usage in the graphical software [CloudCompare](www.cloudcompare.org).


* **4D objects-by-change** (4D-OBC; [Anders et al., 2021](#literature)) for time series-based extraction of surface activities *[under active development]*. The concept and method are explained in this scientific talk:

**Coming next:**
* **Correspondence-driven plane-based M3C2** ([Zahs et al., 2022](#literature)) for lower uncertainty in 3D topographic change quantification. The concept and method are explained in this scientific talk:

## üíª Installation

### Prerequisites

Using py4dgeo requires the following software installed:

* 64-bit Python `>= 3.8` (32-bit installations might cause trouble during installation of dependencies)

In order to build the package from source, the following tools are also needed.

* A C++17-compliant compiler
* CMake `>= 3.9`
* Doxygen (optional, documentation building is skipped if missing)

### Installing py4dgeo

The preferred way of installing `py4dgeo` is using `pip`.

### Installing the release version using pip

`py4dgeo` can be installed using `pip` to obtain the [current release](https://pypi.org/project/py4dgeo/):

```
python -m pip install py4dgeo
```

### Building from source using pip

The following sequence of commands is used to build `py4dgeo` from source:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/py4dgeo.git
cd py4dgeo
python -m pip install -v --editable .
```

The `--editable` flag allows you to change the Python sources of `py4dgeo` without
reinstalling the package. The `-v` flag enables verbose output which gives you
detailed information about the compilation process that you should include into
potential bug reports. To recompile the C++ source, please run `pip install` again.
In order to enable multi-threading on builds from source, your compiler toolchain
needs to support `OpenMP`.

If you want to contribute to the library's development you should also install
its additional Python dependencies for testing and documentation building:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Setting up py4dgeo using Docker

Additionally, `py4dgeo` provides a Docker image that allows to explore
the library using JupyterLab. The image can be locally built and run with
the following commands:

```
docker build -t py4dgeo:latest .
docker run -t -p 8888:8888 py4dgeo:latest
```

## üêç Documentation of software usage

As a starting point, please have a look to the [Jupyter Notebooks](notebooks) available in the repository and find the `py4dgeo` documentation [on readthedocs](https://py4dgeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html).
