    "The dataset is a subsampled version of the original time series, using 12-hourly epochs of point clouds and spatial subsampling to 50 cm. The dataset [can be downloaded](https://zenodo.org/records/10003575) (module3.zip) from the E-learning course E-TRAINEE. In the data directory `kijkduin`, you find the prepared input point clouds and a core points point cloud, which is manually cleaned from noise.\n",

    "### Loading data and calculation of surface changes\n",
    "\n",
    "We first prepare the analysis by compiling the list of files (epochs) and reading the timestamps from the file names (format `YYMMDD_hhmmss`) into `datetime` objects. Use the point cloud files and timestamps to create a py4dgeo `SpatiotemporalAnalysis` object. For this we need to instantiate the M3C2 algorithm. We can use the point cloud file `170115_150816_aoi_50cm.laz` as core points. Explore the point cloud properties in CloudCompare: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Considering the available point density and surface characteristics, what would be a suitable cylinder radius for the distance calculation?\n",
    "* What would be a suitable approach to derive the surface normals in this topography and expected types of surface changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: In this flat topography and predominant provess of sand deposition and erosion, it can be suitable to orient the normals purely vertically. In this case, they do not need to be computed, and you can [customize the py4dgeo algorithm](https://py4dgeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization.html#Changing-search-directions) accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the first point cloud in the time series (list of files) as reference epoch. We can assume a registration error of 1.9 cm for the M3C2 distance calculation (cf. <a href=\"#references\">Vos et al., 2022</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatiotemporal change information can be explored by visualizing the changes at a selected epoch and visualizing the time series at a selected location. "

    "When using a small number of clusters (k=5), a large part of the beach is assigned to one cluster of assumingly little activity (gray area). From our exploration of changes in the scene at a selected epoch above, we further obtain two clusters with mainly deposition (blue clusters) and one cluster in the erosion areas around the pathway through the dunes. With a higher number of clusters (k=10 to k=50), the coarser clusters are further split up into (assumingly) finer patterns."

    "Now we can relate the temporal behavior to the spatial clusters. For example, we see strong and sudden surface increases for the orange and red clusters (with different timing and magnitude). The gray cluster (occuring in two spatial extents) represents sand bars, which we know from our time series example above. The large coverage of the brown cluster shows a time series with little activity - except for fluctuations, especially towards the end of the observation period, which is contained in all clusters. We can assume that this represents some measurement effects in the data that could not be corrected by the preprocessing and alignment procedure ([Vos et al., 2022])."
