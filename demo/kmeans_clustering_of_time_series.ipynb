    "Now we can relate the temporal behavior to the spatial clusters. For example, we see strong and sudden surface increases for the orange and red clusters (with different timing and magnitude). The gray cluster (occuring in two spatial extents) represents sand bars, which we know from our time series example above. The large coverage of the brown cluster shows a time series with little activity - except for fluctuations, especially towards the end of the observation period, which is contained in all clusters. We can assume that this represents some measurement effects in the data that could not be corrected by the preprocessing and alignment procedure ([Vos et al., 2022])."
